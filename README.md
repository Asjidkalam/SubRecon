# SubRecon
Fast Subdomain Takeover Enumeration tool written in Go. It uses Golang concurrency and hence is very fast. It can easily detect potential subdomain takeovers that exist. Currently it only has 3 services, more services will be added soon..

## Installing

You need to have Golang installed on your machine. There are no additional requirements for this tool.

```sh
go get github.com/Asjidkalam/SubRecon
```

## Usage

` ./SubRecon -i hosts.txt -o results.txt`
- `-i` List of Subdomains
- `-o` Output/Result file

This tool is created during learning GoLang and hence the project is deprecated.
